# Modular Pipelines

Modular Pipelines is a lightweight and extensible library to create complex multi-model and multi-modal pipelines.

**Ensemble Learning** → Ensemble learning is a general meta approach to machine learning that seeks better predictive performance by combining the predictions from multiple models. See more on wikipedia Wiki - Ensemble Learning or A Gentle Introduction to Ensemble Learning Algorithms

**Meta Learning** → in machine learning refers to learning algorithms that learn from other learning algorithms. Most commonly, this means the use of machine learning algorithms that learn how to best combine the predictions from other machine learning algorithms in the field of ensemble learning.
