        We are Applied Exploration, a Machine Learning Research Studio
        specialized in translating State-of-the-Art algorithms into practical
        use-cases.
        <br />
        Based in Berlin, we currently collaborate with Machine Learning
        Practicioners and Researcherss across Europe and the Americas.
        <br />
        Some of the topics we are interested in: Graph Neural Networks Machine
        Learning applied to Code Intelligence Quantative pipelines by combining
        multiple models Neuro-symbolic approaches, eg. symbolic regression.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since 2021 we have been developing a community of likeminded
        individuals, who we meet weekly for: Project Demonstrations and Deep
        Dives Mini-lectures on computational topics, eg.: Caustics Paper Reviews
        on new, exciting papers. If you would like to apply to the community
        then DM us on @hellosemy or @itchingpixels to join the family. Subscribe
        to our progress.

        Become part of the journey in experimenting with a new way of organising
        technological spin-offs. We write deep insights into what went well and
        wrong in our projects, and show the state of affairs in those segments.
